# speakit
Application for generating speech for online role playing games so that players who want to remain in character can do so.

## The purpose of this app

	This application is meant for use primarily
	with online games which require voice
	communication.  It can also be used by
	the disabled to allow them to participate 
	in voice chat if they are incapable of 
	speaking.  Used in conjunction with tools
	such as Soundflower 
	(http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/) 
	it is possible to route the output of the 
	speech to any audio destination you like.   

	Restrictions of the Apple app store 
	prevent inclusion of Soundflower into this 
	application.   You can also use Audio Hijack 
	to re-route the sound output for this 
	application to your  MMORPG of choice. :)

	Go into your settings on your favorite 
	game (Second Life, WoW) and set it to 
	take input from the audio channel that this 
	program is outputting to.
